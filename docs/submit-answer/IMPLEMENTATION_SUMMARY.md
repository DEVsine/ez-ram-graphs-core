# Student-Knowledge Relationship Tracking - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Related ADR**: [ADR 0001](adr/0001-student-knowledge-relationship-tracking.md)

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented Student-Knowledge relationship tracking in Neo4j with two update mechanisms:

1. **Automatic Updates** - During quiz submission, Student-Knowledge relationships are automatically created/updated in Neo4j
2. **Manual Adjustments** - Dedicated API endpoint allows authorized users (teachers, admins) to directly update student knowledge scores

This provides both seamless integration with the quiz flow and flexibility for manual overrides, bulk imports, and external integrations.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Service Layer ✅

**File**: `student/services/adjust_knowledge_service.py`

**Class**: `AdjustKnowledgeService(BaseService)`

**Key Features**:

- Accepts manual adjustment requests with flexible input formats
- Supports absolute scores (`score: 7.5`) and score deltas (`score_delta: 2.0`)
- Supports knowledge lookup by element_id or name
- Creates or updates Student-Knowledge relationships in Neo4j
- Updates UserProfile JSON with new scores
- Full audit logging with source, adjusted_by, and reason
- Resilient error handling (individual failures don't stop processing)

**Key Methods**:

- `run()` - Main entry point, orchestrates the adjustment flow
- `_get_student()` - Retrieve student node from Neo4j
- `_load_user_profile()` - Load or create student profile
- `_build_knowledge_map()` - Build knowledge nodes lookup map
- `_process_adjustment()` - Process single adjustment
- `_update_relationship()` - Create/update Neo4j relationship
- `_save_user_profile()` - Persist profile to JSON

### 2. API Layer ✅

**File**: `student/api_views.py`

**Class**: `AdjustKnowledgeAPI(BaseAPIView)`

**Endpoint**: `POST /student/v1/<ram_id>/adjust-knowledge/`

**Features**:

- Token authentication required
- Request validation via serializer
- Permission checks (TODO: Add IsTeacherOrAdmin permission class)
- Delegates to service layer
- Returns detailed adjustment results

### 3. Serialization Layer ✅

**File**: `student/serializers.py`

**Classes**:

- `KnowledgeAdjustmentSerializer` - Validates individual adjustment
- `AdjustKnowledgeRequestSerializer` - Validates full request

**Validation Rules**:

- `knowledge_id` - Required (element_id or name)
- `score` - Optional, range -5.0 to 10.0
- `score_delta` - Optional, any float
- `total_attempts` - Optional, non-negative integer
- `total_correct` - Optional, non-negative integer
- `metadata` - Optional, dict for additional properties
- At least one of score/score_delta/total_attempts/total_correct required

### 4. URL Routing ✅

**File**: `student/urls.py`

**Route**: `v1/<str:ram_id>/adjust-knowledge/`  
**Name**: `adjust-knowledge`  
**View**: `AdjustKnowledgeAPI`

### 5. Neo4j Model ✅

**File**: `student/neo_models.py`

**New Relationship Model**: `StudentKnowledgeRel(StructuredRel)`

**Properties**:

- `last_score` - FloatProperty (most recent score)
- `last_updated` - DateTimeProperty (timestamp of last update)
- `total_attempts` - IntegerProperty (total quiz attempts)
- `total_correct` - IntegerProperty (total correct answers)

**Updated Student Model**:

- `related_to` relationship now uses `StudentKnowledgeRel` model
- Supports relationship properties for tracking learning progress

{
  "student_id": "123-ceo",
  "updated_count": 1,
  "created_count": 1,
  "adjustments": [
    {
      "knowledge_id": "4:node:123",
      "knowledge_name": "Simple Tense",
      "old_score": 5.0,
      "new_score": 7.5,
      "action": "updated"
    },
    {
      "knowledge_id": "4:node:124",
      "knowledge_name": "Perfect Tense",
      "old_score": 3.0,
      "new_score": 5.0,
      "action": "created"
    }
  ],
  "source": "teacher_override",
  "adjusted_by": "teacher@example.com",
  "reason": "Placement test results",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## Use Cases Supported

1. ✅ **Teacher Override**: Teacher manually adjusts student mastery after assessment
2. ✅ **Placement Test**: Initialize student knowledge based on placement test results
3. ✅ **Bulk Import**: Import student knowledge from external learning management system
4. ✅ **Administrative Correction**: Fix incorrect scores or data migration issues
5. ✅ **External Integration**: Allow other platforms to update student knowledge

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. ⏳ Add permission class `IsTeacherOrAdmin`
2. ⏳ Implement permission check in API view
3. ⏳ Write comprehensive unit tests
4. ⏳ Write integration tests
5. ⏳ Write API tests
6. ⏳ Test with sample data

### Short-term (Week 2-3)

1. ⏳ Add audit logging to database (not just logs)
2. ⏳ Create management command for bulk adjustments
3. ⏳ Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
4. ⏳ Performance testing with large datasets
5. ⏳ Add rate limiting for adjustment endpoint

### Long-term (Month 2+)

1. ⏳ Build admin UI for bulk adjustments
2. ⏳ Add export/import functionality
3. ⏳ Integration with external learning platforms
4. ⏳ Analytics dashboard for adjustment history
5. ⏳ Automated placement test integration

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Permission Enforcement**: Currently only checks `IsAuthenticated`, needs `IsTeacherOrAdmin`
2. **No Audit Database**: Audit trail only in logs, not in database
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Could be abused without rate limiting
4. **No Bulk UI**: Only API available, no admin interface
5. **No Validation of Score Ranges**: Accepts any score within -5 to 10, but doesn't validate against knowledge difficulty

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

None required (uses existing Django/Neo4j configuration)

### Permissions

- Requires authentication (TokenAuthentication)
- TODO: Requires teacher or admin role

### Data Storage

- **Neo4j**: Student-Knowledge relationships with properties
- **JSON Files**: UserProfile in `data/profiles/{student_id}.json`

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging

All adjustments logged at INFO level with:

- Student ID
- Number of adjustments
- Source and adjusted_by
- Old and new scores
- Action (created/updated)

### Metrics to Track

- Number of manual adjustments per day
- Most frequently adjusted knowledge topics
- Average score changes
- Adjustment sources (teacher, placement test, etc.)
- Error rates

---

## Security Considerations

### Current

- ✅ Authentication required (TokenAuthentication)
- ✅ Input validation via serializers
- ✅ Audit logging with source and adjusted_by

### TODO

- ⏳ Authorization (teacher/admin only)
- ⏳ Rate limiting
- ⏳ Audit trail in database
- ⏳ Prevent students from adjusting their own knowledge
- ⏳ Validate adjustment reasons

---

## Documentation Updated

- ✅ Requirements: Added FR-8 for manual adjustment
- ✅ Requirements: Added API contract for `/adjust-knowledge/`
- ✅ README: Added manual adjustment to capabilities
- ✅ ADR 0001: Added manual adjustment design and implementation
- ⏳ Design: TODO - Add manual adjustment section
- ⏳ Testing: TODO - Add test cases for manual adjustment

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional

- ✅ API endpoint accepts adjustment requests
- ✅ Validates input correctly
- ✅ Updates UserProfile JSON
- ✅ Creates/updates Neo4j relationships
- ✅ Returns detailed results
- ✅ Logs all adjustments

### Non-Functional

- ⏳ Processes 100 adjustments in < 5 seconds
- ⏳ 95%+ success rate
- ⏳ Zero data inconsistencies
- ⏳ Full audit trail
