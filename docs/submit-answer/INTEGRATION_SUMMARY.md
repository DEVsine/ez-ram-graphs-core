# Student-Knowledge Graph Integration - Complete Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY INTEGRATED  
**Related ADR**: [ADR 0001](adr/0001-student-knowledge-relationship-tracking.md)

---

## Overview

Successfully integrated Student-Knowledge relationship tracking into the quiz submission flow. The system now automatically updates Neo4j graph relationships when students submit quiz answers, while also providing a manual adjustment API for teacher overrides and bulk operations.

### Two Update Mechanisms

1. **üîÑ Automatic Updates** (Primary Flow)
   - Triggered during quiz answer submission
   - Seamlessly integrated into `SubmitAnswersService`
   - No additional API calls needed
   - Updates happen in real-time as students learn

2. **‚úã Manual Adjustments** (Secondary Flow)
   - Dedicated API endpoint for authorized users
   - Supports teacher overrides, placement tests, bulk imports
   - Flexible input formats (absolute scores or deltas)
   - Full audit trail

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Automatic Updates (Integrated into Quiz Submission)

**File**: `student/services/submit_answers_service.py`

**New Method**: `_update_student_knowledge_links()`

**Integration Point**: Line 96 - Called after profile is saved

```python
# Save updated profile
self._save_user_profile(profile, student_id)

# Build response
graph_updates = self._build_graph_updates(all_adjustments, kg)

# Update Student-Knowledge relationships in Neo4j (NEW!)
self._update_student_knowledge_links(
    student_node, all_adjustments, profile, kg
)
```

**What It Does**:
1. Builds a map of all Knowledge nodes for efficient lookup
2. For each knowledge node affected by quiz answers:
   - Checks if Student-Knowledge relationship exists
   - If exists: Updates properties (score, timestamp, attempts, correct count)
   - If not: Creates new relationship with initial properties
3. Logs all created/updated relationships
4. Continues processing even if individual updates fail

**Relationship Properties Stored**:
- `last_score` - Current score from UserProfile
- `last_updated` - Timestamp (UTC)
- `total_attempts` - Incremented by 1 on each quiz
- `total_correct` - Incremented by 1 if answer was correct

**Example Flow**:
```
Student submits quiz answer
  ‚Üì
Check if answer is correct
  ‚Üì
Calculate score adjustments
  ‚Üì
Update UserProfile JSON
  ‚Üì
Update Student-Knowledge relationships in Neo4j ‚Üê NEW!
  ‚Üì
Return response with graph updates
```

### 2. Manual Adjustment API (Separate Endpoint)

**File**: `student/services/adjust_knowledge_service.py`

**Endpoint**: `POST /student/v1/<ram_id>/adjust-knowledge/`

**Use Cases**:
- Teacher manually adjusts student mastery after assessment
- Placement test initializes student knowledge baseline
- Bulk import from external learning management system
- Administrative corrections or data migration
- Integration with other learning platforms

**Request Example**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "123-ceo",
  "adjustments": [
    {
      "knowledge_id": "4:node:123",
      "score": 7.5,
      "total_attempts": 10,
      "total_correct": 8
    },
    {
      "knowledge_id": "Simple Tense",
      "score_delta": 2.0
    }
  ],
  "source": "teacher_override",
  "adjusted_by": "teacher@example.com",
  "reason": "Placement test results"
}
```

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "123-ceo",
  "updated_count": 1,
  "created_count": 1,
  "adjustments": [
    {
      "knowledge_id": "4:node:123",
      "knowledge_name": "Simple Tense",
      "old_score": 5.0,
      "new_score": 7.5,
      "action": "updated"
    }
  ],
  "source": "teacher_override",
  "adjusted_by": "teacher@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## Neo4j Graph Structure

### Student Node
```cypher
(:Student {
  username: "ceo",
  db_id: "123-ceo"
})
```

### Knowledge Node
```cypher
(:Knowledge {
  name: "Simple Tense",
  element_id: "4:node:123"
})
```

### Relationship (NEW!)
```cypher
(:Student)-[:RELATED_TO {
  last_score: 7.5,
  last_updated: datetime("2025-10-08T14:30:00Z"),
  total_attempts: 10,
  total_correct: 8
}]->(:Knowledge)
```

## Example Cypher Queries

### Find all knowledge topics a student has engaged with
```cypher
MATCH (s:Student {db_id: "123-ceo"})-[r:RELATED_TO]->(k:Knowledge)
RETURN k.name, r.last_score, r.total_attempts, r.total_correct
ORDER BY r.last_updated DESC
```

### Find students struggling with a specific topic
```cypher
MATCH (s:Student)-[r:RELATED_TO]->(k:Knowledge {name: "Simple Tense"})
WHERE r.last_score < 5.0
RETURN s.username, r.last_score, r.total_attempts
ORDER BY r.last_score ASC
```

### Find students who haven't engaged with a topic
```cypher
MATCH (s:Student), (k:Knowledge {name: "Simple Tense"})
WHERE NOT (s)-[:RELATED_TO]->(k)
RETURN s.username
```

### Calculate average mastery per knowledge topic
```cypher
MATCH (s:Student)-[r:RELATED_TO]->(k:Knowledge)
RETURN k.name, 
       AVG(r.last_score) as avg_score,
       COUNT(s) as student_count
ORDER BY avg_score ASC
```
