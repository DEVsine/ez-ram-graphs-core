- ✅ Spaced repetition scheduling
- ✅ Prerequisite-aware adjustments
- 🚧 Student-Knowledge relationship tracking (planned)

### Technology Stack
- **API**: Django REST Framework
- **Service**: Class-based service (BaseService)
- **Graph DB**: Neo4j (via neomodel)
- **Storage**: JSON files for profiles
- **Algorithm**: Quiz Suggestion Engine (NetworkX + Pydantic)
