# Submit Answer - Requirements

## Summary

The Submit Answer feature allows students to submit quiz answers and automatically updates their learning progress based on correctness. The system tracks knowledge mastery through a sophisticated scoring algorithm that adjusts student profiles and maintains a knowledge graph of their learning journey.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Answer Submission

**Priority**: MUST HAVE

Students must be able to submit one or more quiz answers in a single request.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Accept multiple answer submissions in a single API call
- Each answer must include:
  - `quiz_gid`: The graph ID of the quiz question
  - `answer_gid`: The graph ID of the selected answer choice
  - `time_to_answer` (optional): Time taken to answer in seconds
  - `use_helper` (optional): List of helpers used (e.g., "cut-choice", "two-answer")
  - `time_read_answer` (optional): Time spent reading the answer
  - `choice_cutting` (optional): List of eliminated choice IDs
- Student must be identified by `student_id` (db_id)

### FR-2: Answer Validation

**Priority**: MUST HAVE

The system must validate each submitted answer against the correct answer stored in the knowledge graph.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Retrieve quiz from Neo4j using `quiz_gid`
- Compare submitted `answer_gid` with correct choice in quiz
- Return boolean correctness for each answer
- Handle missing quizzes gracefully (log warning, continue processing other answers)
- Handle missing choices gracefully (log warning, mark as incorrect)

### FR-3: Score Updates

**Priority**: MUST HAVE

Student learning scores must be updated based on answer correctness using the quiz suggestion engine.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Load or create student UserProfile from JSON file storage
- Load knowledge graph from Neo4j
- For each answer:
  - Calculate score adjustments for linked knowledge nodes
  - Apply correct/incorrect scoring algorithm
  - Update spaced repetition schedule
  - Track attempt history
- Accumulate all score adjustments across multiple answers
- Save updated profile to persistent storage

### FR-4: Knowledge Graph Integration

**Priority**: MUST HAVE

The system must integrate with the knowledge graph to track which knowledge nodes are affected by each answer.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Load knowledge graph structure from Neo4j
- Identify knowledge nodes linked to each quiz
- Calculate score deltas for each affected knowledge node
- Return graph updates showing:
  - Knowledge node ID
  - Knowledge node name
  - Score adjustment amount (positive or negative)
- Sort updates by absolute adjustment magnitude (largest first)

### FR-5: Student-Knowledge Relationship Tracking

**Priority**: SHOULD HAVE

The system should create and maintain RELATED_TO relationships between Student nodes and Knowledge nodes in Neo4j to track which topics a student has engaged with.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Create or retrieve Student node in Neo4j
- For each knowledge node with score adjustments:
  - Create or update RELATED_TO relationship from Student to Knowledge node
  - Store relationship properties:
    - `last_score`: Most recent score for this knowledge topic
    - `last_updated`: Timestamp of last update
    - `total_attempts`: Total number of quiz attempts for this topic
    - `total_correct`: Total number of correct answers for this topic
  - Avoid duplicate relationships (check before creating)
- Handle Neo4j connection failures gracefully
- Log relationship creation/updates for audit trail

**Current Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED (2025-10-08) - Automatically updates on quiz submission

### FR-6: Error Handling

**Priority**: MUST HAVE

The system must handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Validate required fields (student_id, answers)
- Return 400 error for missing required fields
- Return 500 error for knowledge graph loading failures
- Continue processing remaining answers if one fails
- Log all errors with context
- Never expose internal errors to API consumers

### FR-7: Response Format

**Priority**: MUST HAVE

The API must return a consistent response format with student info and graph updates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Return student information:
  - `name`: Student username
  - `db_id`: Student database ID
- Return graph updates array:
  - `graph_id`: Knowledge node element ID
  - `knowledge`: Knowledge node name
  - `adjustment`: Score change (rounded to 2 decimals)
- Sort graph updates by absolute adjustment (descending)

### FR-8: Manual Knowledge Adjustment

**Priority**: SHOULD HAVE

The system should allow authorized users (teachers, admins) to manually adjust student knowledge scores through a dedicated API endpoint.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Accept manual adjustment requests with:
  - `student_id`: Student identifier
  - `adjustments`: List of knowledge adjustments
  - `source`: Source of adjustment (e.g., "teacher_override", "placement_test")
  - `adjusted_by`: User/system making the adjustment
  - `reason`: Optional reason for adjustment
- Support multiple adjustment formats:
  - Absolute score: Set exact score value
  - Score delta: Adjust by relative amount
  - Metadata updates: Update attempts/correct counts
- Support knowledge lookup by element_id or name
- Validate permissions (teacher/admin only)
- Create or update Student-Knowledge relationships in Neo4j
- Update UserProfile JSON with new scores
- Log all adjustments with full audit trail
- Return detailed results showing what was updated/created
- Prevent students from adjusting their own knowledge

**Current Status**: Planned (see ADR 0001)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance

- Process up to 100 answer submissions in a single request
- Complete processing within 5 seconds for typical workloads (10 answers)

### NFR-2: Data Persistence

- Student profiles must be persisted to JSON files in `data/profiles/`
- Profile files must be named `{student_id}.json`
- Ensure atomic writes to prevent data corruption
- Create directories if they don't exist

### NFR-3: Scalability

- Support concurrent answer submissions from multiple students
- Handle knowledge graphs with 1000+ nodes efficiently
- Process answers independently (failure of one doesn't affect others)

### NFR-4: Observability

- Log all answer submissions at INFO level
- Log processing results (correct/incorrect, adjustments)
- Log errors at WARNING/ERROR level with full context
- Never log sensitive student data

### NFR-5: Security

- Require authentication (TokenAuthentication)
