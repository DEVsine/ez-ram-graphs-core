# ADR 0001: Student-Knowledge Relationship Tracking in Neo4j

## Status

**âœ… IMPLEMENTED** (2025-10-08)

## Context

When students submit quiz answers, the system updates their learning profile (stored in JSON files) with score adjustments for related knowledge nodes. This ADR documents the decision to enable persistent graph relationships in Neo4j between Student nodes and Knowledge nodes to track which topics a student has engaged with.

**Implementation completed on 2025-10-08** with both automatic (quiz submission) and manual (API endpoint) update capabilities.

### Current Implementation

- Student learning data is stored in JSON files (`data/profiles/{student_id}.json`)
- UserProfile contains scores for knowledge nodes (identified by element_id)
- No graph relationships exist between Student and Knowledge nodes in Neo4j
- Code exists to create these relationships but is commented out (lines 94-101 in `submit_answers_service.py`)

### Problem

Without Student-Knowledge relationships in the graph:

1. **No visual learning path**: Cannot visualize what topics a student has studied
2. **Limited graph queries**: Cannot use Cypher to find students by knowledge area
3. **No relationship-based analytics**: Cannot analyze learning patterns across students
4. **Disconnected data**: Student nodes exist in isolation from the knowledge graph

### Commented Code

```python
# link student to knowledge nodes
# for node_id in all_adjustments:
#     try:
#         knowledge_node = NeoKnowledge.nodes.get(name=node_id)
#         student_node.related_to.connect(knowledge_node)
#     except Exception as e:
#         logger.error(f"Failed to link student to knowledge node {node_id}: {e}")
#         continue
```

## Decision

**We propose to ENABLE Student-Knowledge relationship tracking with the following improvements:**

### 1. Create RELATED_TO Relationships

When a student submits answers that affect knowledge node scores, create `Student -[RELATED_TO]-> Knowledge` relationships in Neo4j.

### 2. Add Relationship Properties

Store metadata on the relationship:

- `last_score`: Most recent score for this knowledge node
- `last_updated`: Timestamp of last interaction
- `total_attempts`: Number of quizzes attempted for this knowledge
- `total_correct`: Number of correct answers for this knowledge

### 3. Implement Upsert Logic

- Check if relationship already exists before creating
- Update relationship properties if it exists
- Create new relationship if it doesn't exist

### 4. Use Element ID for Matching

- Match knowledge nodes by `element_id` (not `name`)
- Ensures correct node identification in Neo4j v5+

### 5. Batch Operations

- Collect all relationship updates
- Execute in a single transaction
- Minimize Neo4j round trips

### 6. Manual Adjustment via Function Input

Allow external systems, teachers, or administrators to manually adjust student-knowledge relationships through a dedicated function interface.

**Use Cases**:

- Teacher manually adjusts student mastery level
- Bulk import of student knowledge from external systems
- Administrative corrections or overrides
- Integration with other learning platforms
- Placement test results initialization

**Design Principles**:

- Accept explicit adjustment parameters (not derived from quiz answers)
- Support both score updates and relationship metadata updates
- Validate input to prevent invalid states
- Log all manual adjustments for audit trail
- Maintain consistency with automatic updates

### Updated Neo4j Relationship Model

```python
# In student/neo_models.py
class Student(StructuredNode):
    username = StringProperty(required=True)
    db_id = StringProperty(required=True)

    # Relationship with properties
    related_to = RelationshipTo(
        "knowledge.neo_models.Knowledge",
        "RELATED_TO",
        model=StudentKnowledgeRel  # Custom relationship model
    )

# New relationship model
class StudentKnowledgeRel(StructuredRel):
    """Relationship between Student and Knowledge with learning metadata."""
    last_score = FloatProperty()
    last_updated = DateTimeProperty()
    total_attempts = IntegerProperty(default=0)
    total_correct = IntegerProperty(default=0)
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Rich Graph Queries**: Can query students by knowledge area

   ```cypher
   MATCH (s:Student)-[r:RELATED_TO]->(k:Knowledge {name: "Simple Tense"})
   WHERE r.last_score > 5
   RETURN s.username, r.last_score
   ```

2. **Learning Path Visualization**: Can visualize student's learning journey

   ```cypher
   MATCH (s:Student {db_id: "123-ceo"})-[r:RELATED_TO]->(k:Knowledge)
   RETURN k.name, r.last_score, r.last_updated
   ORDER BY r.last_updated DESC
   ```

3. **Analytics**: Can analyze learning patterns across students

   ```cypher
   MATCH (s:Student)-[r:RELATED_TO]->(k:Knowledge)
   RETURN k.name, AVG(r.last_score) as avg_score, COUNT(s) as student_count
   ORDER BY avg_score DESC
   ```

4. **Cohort Analysis**: Can find students with similar knowledge profiles

   ```cypher
   MATCH (s1:Student)-[:RELATED_TO]->(k:Knowledge)<-[:RELATED_TO]-(s2:Student)
   WHERE s1.db_id = "123-ceo" AND s1 <> s2
   RETURN s2.username, COUNT(k) as shared_knowledge
   ORDER BY shared_knowledge DESC
   ```

5. **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth in graph database

### Negative

1. **Performance Impact**: Additional Neo4j operations per submission
   - Mitigation: Batch operations, use transactions
2. **Complexity**: Need to maintain relationship properties
   - Mitigation: Encapsulate in service method
3. **Data Duplication**: Scores stored in both JSON and graph
   - Mitigation: JSON is source of truth, graph is for relationships
4. **Migration Needed**: Existing students need backfill
   - Mitigation: Create migration script to populate from JSON profiles

### Neutral

1. **Storage Increase**: More relationships in Neo4j
2. **Maintenance**: Need to keep relationship properties in sync

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep JSON-Only Storage

**Pros**: Simple, no graph complexity, fast writes
**Cons**: No graph queries, no visualization, limited analytics
**Decision**: Rejected - loses value of graph database

### Alternative 2: Store All Scores in Neo4j (No JSON)

**Pros**: Single source of truth, full graph power
**Cons**: Complex queries for score retrieval, performance concerns
**Decision**: Rejected - JSON is better for profile data

### Alternative 3: Relationship Without Properties

**Pros**: Simpler implementation
**Cons**: Loses valuable metadata (when, how many attempts)
**Decision**: Rejected - properties add significant value

### Alternative 4: Separate Analytics Database

**Pros**: Optimized for analytics queries
**Cons**: Additional infrastructure, data sync complexity
**Decision**: Rejected - premature optimization

## API Endpoint for Manual Adjustment

To support manual adjustments, we propose adding a new API endpoint:

```
POST /student/v1/<ram_id>/adjust-knowledge/
```

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "student_id": "123-ceo",
  "adjustments": [
    {
      "knowledge_id": "4:node:123",
      "score": 7.5,
      "total_attempts": 10,
      "total_correct": 8
    },
    {
      "knowledge_id": "Simple Tense",
      "score_delta": 2.0
    }
  ],
  "source": "teacher_override",
  "adjusted_by": "teacher@example.com",
  "reason": "Placement test results"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "student_id": "123-ceo",
  "updated_count": 1,
  "created_count": 1,
  "adjustments": [
    {
      "knowledge_id": "4:node:123",
      "knowledge_name": "Simple Tense",
      "old_score": 5.0,
      "new_score": 7.5,
      "action": "updated"
    },
    {
      "knowledge_id": "4:node:124",
      "knowledge_name": "Perfect Tense",
      "old_score": 3.0,
      "new_score": 5.0,
      "action": "created"
    }
  ],
  "source": "teacher_override",
  "adjusted_by": "teacher@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T14:30:00Z"
}
```

**Authorization**:

- Requires elevated permissions (teacher, admin)
- Regular students cannot adjust their own knowledge
- Audit log required for all manual adjustments

**Use Cases**:

1. **Teacher Override**: Teacher manually adjusts student mastery after assessment
2. **Placement Test**: Initialize student knowledge based on placement test results
3. **Bulk Import**: Import student knowledge from external learning management system
4. **Administrative Correction**: Fix incorrect scores or data migration issues
5. **External Integration**: Allow other platforms to update student knowledge

## Summary of Key Decisions

### 1. Automatic Relationship Creation

When students submit quiz answers, automatically create/update `Student -[RELATED_TO]-> Knowledge` relationships in Neo4j with properties tracking learning progress.

### 2. Manual Adjustment Capability

Provide a dedicated function and API endpoint (`adjust_student_knowledge()` and `/adjust-knowledge/`) to allow:

- Teachers to override student knowledge scores
- Administrators to bulk import/correct student data
- External systems to integrate and update student knowledge
- Placement tests to initialize student profiles

### 3. Dual Storage Strategy

- **JSON files**: Source of truth for student profiles (fast access, simple structure)
- **Neo4j relationships**: Enable graph queries, analytics, and visualization
- Relationships store metadata: `last_score`, `last_updated`, `total_attempts`, `total_correct`

### 4. Flexible Input Methods

Support multiple ways to adjust student knowledge:

- **Automatic**: Via quiz answer submission (existing flow)
- **Manual**: Via `adjust_student_knowledge()` function with explicit parameters
- **Absolute scores**: Set exact score value
- **Score deltas**: Adjust by relative amount
- **Metadata updates**: Update attempts/correct counts independently

### 5. Audit Trail

All manual adjustments logged with:

- Source (e.g., "teacher_override", "placement_test", "bulk_import")
- Adjusted by (user/system identifier)
- Timestamp
- Old and new values

This enables full traceability and accountability for all knowledge adjustments.
