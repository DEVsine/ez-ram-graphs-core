# Suggest Quiz Feature Documentation

## üìã Overview

The **Suggest Quiz** feature provides personalized quiz recommendations to students based on their learning progress and weakness areas. The system uses Neo4j Student-Knowledge relationships to identify areas where students need improvement and suggests relevant quizzes.

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Weakness-Based Suggestions**: Prioritizes quizzes for student's weakest knowledge areas
- ‚úÖ **New User Support**: Random quiz selection for initial assessment
- ‚úÖ **Quiz History Deduplication**: Avoids suggesting recently attempted quizzes (last 5)
- ‚úÖ **Topic Scoping**: Filter suggestions by knowledge topic
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Limit**: Control number of quizzes returned

### Quick Links

- **API Endpoint**: `POST /student/v1/<ram_id>/suggest-quiz/`
- **Service**: `student/services/suggest_quiz_service.py`
- **View**: `student/api_views.py` ‚Üí `SuggestQuizAPI`

### Key Components

1. **SuggestQuizAPI** (View Layer)
   - Validates request
   - Calls service
   - Returns response

2. **SuggestQuizService** (Service Layer)
   - Orchestrates quiz suggestion logic
   - Queries Neo4j for student/knowledge/quiz data
   - Manages quiz history deduplication

3. **Neo4j Database** (Data Layer)
   - Student nodes
   - Knowledge nodes
   - Quiz nodes
   - Student-Knowledge relationships (with last_score)

4. **UserProfile** (File Storage)
   - Quiz attempt history (last 15)
   - User scores
   - Spaced repetition schedule

---

## üîÑ Algorithm

### For Existing Users (with knowledge relationships)

1. Query Student-Knowledge relationships ordered by `last_score` ASC (weakest first)
2. For each weakness knowledge node:
   - Get related quizzes
   - Filter out quizzes from last 5 history
   - Add to suggestion list
   - Stop when `quiz_limit` reached

### For New Users (no knowledge relationships)

1. Get all quizzes (or filtered by `scope_topic`)
2. Exclude quizzes from last 5 history
3. Randomly select up to `quiz_limit` quizzes

---

## üìä Data Models

### Neo4j Graph Schema

```
Student -[RELATED_TO]-> Knowledge <-[RELATED_TO]- Quiz
                                                    ‚îÇ
                                                    ‚îî‚îÄ[HAS_CHOICE]-> Choice
```

### StudentKnowledgeRel Properties

- `last_score`: Float (used for weakness detection)
- `last_updated`: DateTime
- `total_attempts`: Integer
- `total_correct`: Integer

### UserProfile (JSON)

- `user_id`: String
- `attempt_history`: List[AttemptRecord] (last 15 quizzes)
- `scores`: Dict[str, float]
- `schedule`: Dict[str, ScheduleEntry]

---

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

- `test_has_knowledge_relationships()`
- `test_get_weakness_knowledge_nodes()`
- `test_get_quizzes_for_knowledge()`
- `test_get_recent_quiz_ids()`
- `test_get_random_quizzes()`

### Integration Tests

- `test_suggest_quiz_existing_user()`
- `test_suggest_quiz_new_user()`
- `test_suggest_quiz_with_topic_filter()`
- `test_suggest_quiz_history_deduplication()`

### Edge Cases

- Student with no quizzes for weakness knowledge
- Empty quiz history
- Topic filter with no matches
- quiz_limit larger than available quizzes

---

## üîß Configuration

### Quiz History Limit

```python
# student/quiz_suggestion/engine/policies.py
ATTEMPT_HISTORY_LEN = 15  # Last 15 quizzes stored
```

### Deduplication Window

```python
# In SuggestQuizService.run()
recent_quiz_ids = self._get_recent_quiz_ids(profile, n=5)  # Last 5 for deduplication
```

---

## üìà Performance

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Cypher Query Optimization**
   - Index on `Student.db_id`
   - Index on `Knowledge.name`
   - Limit results to needed data

2. **Caching**
   - User profiles (file-based, fast)
   - Knowledge graph (session cache)
   - Quiz bank (frequently accessed)

3. **Connection Pooling**
   - Neo4j connection management
   - Configured in `core/settings.py`

## üêõ Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Status | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| Missing username | 400 | Required field not provided | Include `student.username` |
| Invalid quiz_limit | 400 | quiz_limit < 1 | Use quiz_limit >= 1 |
| No quizzes available | 404 | Empty quiz bank | Add quizzes to database |
| Database error | 500 | Neo4j connection issue | Check database connection |

## üìù Change History

### 2025-10-08: Weakness-Based Refactoring

**Changes**:
- Refactored from suggestion engine to weakness-based approach
- Direct Neo4j queries for student knowledge relationships
- Simplified algorithm (removed spaced repetition, prerequisites, difficulty adaptation)
- Updated quiz history limit from 200 to 15

**Rationale**:
- Simpler, more maintainable code
- Direct use of Neo4j as single source of truth
- Better alignment with business requirements

**Migration**:
- No data migration required
- Backward compatible API
- Existing user profiles continue to work

---

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Adaptive Difficulty** (Q1 2026)
   - Match quiz difficulty to student level
   - Gradually increase difficulty as student improves

2. **Spaced Repetition** (Q2 2026)
   - Prioritize overdue reviews
   - Implement forgetting curve algorithm

3. **Learning Path** (Q2 2026)
   - Suggest knowledge topics to focus on
   - Visualize learning progress

4. **Neo4j Quiz History** (Q3 2026)
   - Move attempt history to Neo4j relationships
   - Enable graph-based analytics

5. **Smart New User Flow** (Q3 2026)
   - Better initial assessment strategy
   - Adaptive first quiz selection
