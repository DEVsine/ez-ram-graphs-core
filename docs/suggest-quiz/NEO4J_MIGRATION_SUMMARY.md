# Neo4j Quiz History Migration Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

## üìã Overview

Successfully migrated quiz history tracking from file-based `UserProfile` to Neo4j Student-[ATTEMPTED]->Quiz relationships. This change makes Neo4j the single source of truth for all student data.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Neo4j Schema Updates

#### Added `StudentQuizRel` Relationship Model

**File**: `student/neo_models.py`

```python
class StudentQuizRel(StructuredRel):
    """
    Relationship between Student and Quiz tracking quiz attempts.

    This relationship tracks when a student attempted a quiz for quiz history
    and deduplication in quiz suggestions.
    """

    attempted_at = DateTimeProperty()
    is_correct = BooleanProperty()
```

**Properties**:
- `attempted_at`: Timestamp when quiz was attempted
- `is_correct`: Whether the student answered correctly

#### Added `attempted` Relationship to Student Model

```python
class Student(StructuredNode):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Relationship to Quiz tracking quiz attempts (for history and deduplication)
    attempted = RelationshipTo(
        "quiz.neo_models.Quiz", "ATTEMPTED", model=StudentQuizRel
    )
```

---

### 2. Service Layer Updates

#### Updated `SuggestQuizService`

**File**: `student/services/suggest_quiz_service.py`

**Removed**:
- ‚ùå `from pathlib import Path`
- ‚ùå `from student.quiz_suggestion import UserProfile`
- ‚ùå `_load_user_profile()` method
- ‚ùå All UserProfile references

**Updated**:
- ‚úÖ Class docstring to reflect Neo4j quiz history
- ‚úÖ `run()` method to remove UserProfile loading
- ‚úÖ `_get_recent_quiz_ids()` to query from Neo4j

#### New `_get_recent_quiz_ids()` Implementation

**Before** (File-based):
```python
def _get_recent_quiz_ids(self, profile: UserProfile, n: int = 5) -> Set[str]:
    recent_attempts = (
        profile.attempt_history[-n:] if profile.attempt_history else []
    )
    quiz_ids = {attempt.quiz_id for attempt in recent_attempts}
    return quiz_ids
```

**After** (Neo4j-based):
```python
def _get_recent_quiz_ids(self, student_node: NeoStudent, n: int = 5) -> Set[str]:
    query = """
    MATCH (s:Student)-[r:ATTEMPTED]->(q:Quiz)
    WHERE elementId(s) = $student_id
    RETURN q, r.attempted_at as attempted_at
    ORDER BY r.attempted_at DESC
    LIMIT $limit
    """
    params = {
        "student_id": student_node.element_id,
        "limit": n
    }
    
    results, _ = db.cypher_query(query, params)
    
    quiz_ids = set()
    for row in results:
        quiz_node = NeoQuiz.inflate(row[0])
        if quiz_node and hasattr(quiz_node, 'element_id'):
            quiz_ids.add(quiz_node.element_id)
    
    return quiz_ids
```

**Key Changes**:
- Parameter changed from `profile: UserProfile` to `student_node: NeoStudent`
- Queries Neo4j for last N quiz attempts
- Orders by `attempted_at` DESC (most recent first)
- Returns set of quiz element IDs

---

## üéØ Benefits

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- All student data now in Neo4j
- No dual storage (Neo4j + JSON files)
- Eliminates data synchronization issues

### 2. Consistency
- Quiz history tracked in same database as knowledge relationships
- Unified data model for all student learning data

### 3. Simplicity
- Removed dependency on file-based UserProfile system
- Fewer moving parts, easier to maintain
- No file I/O operations

### 4. Scalability
- Graph database better suited for relationship queries
- Efficient querying with Cypher
- Better performance for large datasets

### 5. Graph Capabilities
- Can analyze quiz attempt patterns
- Can find relationships between quiz attempts and knowledge scores
- Enables advanced analytics

---

## üìä Data Model

### Graph Schema

```
Student -[ATTEMPTED]-> Quiz
        -[RELATED_TO]-> Knowledge <-[RELATED_TO]- Quiz
```

### Relationship Properties

**StudentQuizRel** (Student-[ATTEMPTED]->Quiz):
- `attempted_at`: DateTimeProperty (when quiz was attempted)
- `is_correct`: BooleanProperty (whether answer was correct)

**StudentKnowledgeRel** (Student-[RELATED_TO]->Knowledge):
- `last_score`: FloatProperty (current mastery level)
- `last_updated`: DateTimeProperty
- `total_attempts`: IntegerProperty
- `total_correct`: IntegerProperty

---

## üîÑ Migration Impact

### Breaking Changes

1. **Requires `submit_answers_service` update**
   - Must create Student-[ATTEMPTED]->Quiz relationships
   - Must set `attempted_at` and `is_correct` properties

2. **Existing quiz history not migrated**
   - JSON file-based history will not be automatically migrated
   - Fresh start for quiz history tracking
   - Old JSON files can be archived or deleted

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **API endpoint unchanged**: `POST /student/v1/<ram_id>/suggest-quiz/`  
‚úÖ **Request format unchanged**: Same input parameters  
‚úÖ **Response format unchanged**: Same output structure  
‚úÖ **Service interface unchanged**: Same public methods

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)

1. **Update `submit_answers_service`** ‚úÖ CRITICAL
   - Create Student-[ATTEMPTED]->Quiz relationship when quiz is submitted
   - Set `attempted_at` to current timestamp
   - Set `is_correct` based on answer correctness
   
   Example:
   ```python
   from datetime import datetime
   
   # In submit_answers_service
   student_node.attempted.connect(
       quiz_node,
       {
           'attempted_at': datetime.now(),
           'is_correct': is_answer_correct
       }
   )
   ```

2. **Test quiz history tracking**
   - Submit quiz answers
   - Verify Student-[ATTEMPTED]->Quiz relationships created
   - Verify suggest-quiz excludes recent quizzes

### Short-term (Recommended)

1. **Add quiz history cleanup**
   - Limit to last 15 quiz attempts per student
   - Delete older ATTEMPTED relationships
   - Implement in submit_answers_service or background job

2. **Add indexes for performance**
   ```cypher
   CREATE INDEX student_attempted_at IF NOT EXISTS
   FOR ()-[r:ATTEMPTED]-()
   ON (r.attempted_at)
   ```

3. **Update documentation**
   - Update submit-answer docs to mention quiz history
   - Update Neo4j schema documentation
   - Update API documentation

### Long-term (Optional)

1. **Migrate existing quiz history**
   - Write migration script to read JSON files
   - Create ATTEMPTED relationships from historical data
   - Archive old JSON files

2. **Add analytics**
   - Quiz attempt patterns
   - Correlation between quiz attempts and knowledge scores
   - Student learning velocity

3. **Add quiz attempt metadata**
   - Time spent on quiz
   - Number of attempts
   - Difficulty level at time of attempt

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test `_get_recent_quiz_ids()` with no quiz history
- [ ] Test `_get_recent_quiz_ids()` with < 5 quizzes
- [ ] Test `_get_recent_quiz_ids()` with > 5 quizzes
- [ ] Test quiz deduplication in suggest-quiz

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test full flow: submit answer ‚Üí create ATTEMPTED relationship
- [ ] Test full flow: suggest quiz ‚Üí exclude recent quizzes
- [ ] Test with new user (no quiz history)
- [ ] Test with existing user (has quiz history)

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Submit quiz answer, verify ATTEMPTED relationship created
- [ ] Request quiz suggestions, verify recent quizzes excluded
- [ ] Check Neo4j browser for correct relationship structure
- [ ] Verify timestamps are correct

---

## üìù Code Examples

### Creating Quiz Attempt Relationship

```python
# In submit_answers_service.py
from datetime import datetime

def save_quiz_attempt(student_node, quiz_node, is_correct):
    """Save quiz attempt to Neo4j."""
    student_node.attempted.connect(
        quiz_node,
        {
            'attempted_at': datetime.now(),
            'is_correct': is_correct
        }
    )
```

### Querying Quiz History

```cypher
// Get last 5 quizzes attempted by student
MATCH (s:Student {username: 'ceo'})-[r:ATTEMPTED]->(q:Quiz)
RETURN q.quiz_text, r.attempted_at, r.is_correct
ORDER BY r.attempted_at DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Cleanup Old Quiz History

```cypher
// Keep only last 15 quiz attempts per student
MATCH (s:Student)-[r:ATTEMPTED]->(q:Quiz)
WITH s, r
ORDER BY r.attempted_at DESC
WITH s, COLLECT(r) as attempts
FOREACH (r IN attempts[15..] | DELETE r)
```
